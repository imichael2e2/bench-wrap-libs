* About this benchmark

1. The sample file's content is something like:
   #+begin_src
     abaaebdd c a deeccadd cbcbedbaeadecbdbccbdbeeaaa bacecddd cb cdcabcdccdceecca cc aeebeaee bededdbddddad ae d bcaacccaba eccdc   cadc aac   eddedbada  babbd bbb bbbcdd aecd becc ab debb   daecbeddaedaaebaccba edd dac d  adba c ebba dc aeede   bcdde bed b eb ddbdaacbe bda   aa d
   #+end_src

   These samples are *generated randomly* from a characters pool which
   consists of alphabets "abcde" and ASCII space " ", resulting
   in 30 files of size ranging from about 30 KB to about 1 MB.
   

2. All libraries are assigned the *same task*: take samples from standard
   in, wrap them with an 80-width limit, then print out the result to
   standard out. 

3. Although all libraries' results are distinct from each other, they
   are *correct enough*, i.e. no lines exceed the 80-width limit.

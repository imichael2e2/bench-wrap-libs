* About this benchmark

1. Samples are generated randomly from a group of alphabets, resulting
   in files of size ranging from about 30 KB to about 1 MB. 

2. All libraries are assigned the same job: take samples from standard
   in, wrap them with an 80-width limit, then print out the result to
   standard out. 

3. Although all libraries' results are distinct from each other, they
   are correct enough, i.e. no lines exceed the 80-width limit.
